Notes
------------------------------------------------
Design:
 - .Exe
	- GUI for toggling hacks, interfacing with user, etc...
	- Sends "window messages" to given "maplestory" handle to interface/interact with hacks (toggle on/off, etc...).
		- .exe sends first message telling .dll what handle to interact with. 
			- .DLL could send messages back to .exe, data interaction (passing values back and forth) would have to ...
	--------
	* First Run:
		- Set default MS path from Registry(HK...)
		- Check for updates
		- 
 - .Dll


Overall:
 - Auto update - When opened, it uses latest version of trainer.
   - Sheer: I'd like this to be forced, and smooth when launched, as mine did before.
		- Can't use my current update software cause it requires a lot of manual work for a simple patch, my PVC(Project version control) (the patch management program) isn't complete.

-----------------
 - Create Auto Update methods
 - HackLib - A library for toggling the hacks. Easier to update, manage, create, etc...

 -- Ideas
   - DirectX Interface *or* different overlay. (couldn't we overlay a .net interface?)
